# masterstandup
This will be a site where you can master your standup material by submitting jokes and getting them reviewed by other users.

## Feedback on Jokes
- When you submit a joke, the jokes should be reviewed anonymously to remove any bias. 
- Jokes should be reviewed by several users so that you don't toss a joke out just because one person didn't like it.
- Feedback should come in two parts, a general score (1 to 5 stars), and some written feedback detailing how the joke could be improved etc.
- 

## Future Functionality
- Have reviewers of jokes get paid per joke. 
- I'd like to have the community create content together. For example if I gave the topic "How to Slide Into Dr. Fauci's DM's" ... each user could provide punchlines, the best ones could be curated, and the final article published on the site, giving credit to writers and (if the site makes money) monetary compensation.
- Users new to comedy could buy a subscription and get help from experienced comics.
- The site could copyright your material as soon as it's published to the site so that you have record that you wrote a joke.
- Content written by comedians on comedy could be published to the site. For example, reviews of the latest standup specials, or dissecting a joke.
- Users could submit sketches for feedback.
- Users could submit audio or video of their jokes/sets and get feedback on delivery.
- Tools could be added that would help you write jokes within the app. For example, a thesaurus, idioms, search for funny references, google images for brainstorming, rhyming words, wordplay tools, association lists tool etc. 
- A/B testing on jokes so you could submit a joke with several punchlines and see which punchline users prefer.
- Let users donate when they find a specific review of their joke helpful. 
- Let users/reviewers exchange details. Often two people work well together and once you feel comfortable with someone you want to continue working with just them. For the most part reviews would be anonymous but maybe if you found a certain reviewers feedback helpful you could send feedback to only them and not the general community.
- If you're performing your jokes at open mics or showcases you can add dates, venues, and scores to each joke so you can keep track of how each joke is doing. When you want to compile your strongest set you can easily sort by their average rating.
